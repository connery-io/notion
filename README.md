# Notion

This plugin enables interaction with Notion-based knowledge repositories,
allowing users to query and retrieve answers from both public and private Notion pages.
The plugin integrates with OpenAI to provide high-certainty answers based on the content
available in Notion and suggests follow-ups in case of missing content.
